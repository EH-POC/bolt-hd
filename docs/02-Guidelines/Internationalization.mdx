# Internationalization

The default language of `@ehrocks/hero-design-react` is currently English (Australia). If you wish to use other languages, follow the instructions below.

## HeroDesignProvider

`@ehrocks/hero-design-react` provides a React Component `HeroDesignProvider` as a uniform configuration support for components. Including config hero-design locale text globally.

```jsx
import { HeroDesignProvider } from '@ehrocks/hero-design-react';
import enAU from '@ehrocks/hero-design-react/locale/en_AU';

return (
  <HeroDesignProvider locale={enAU}>
    <App />
  </HeroDesignProvider>
);
```

You can see the complete configuration here: HeroDesignProvider.

Note: `en_AU` is the filename, the following table also follows the same rules.

The following languages are currently supported:

| Language            | Filename |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| English (Australia) | en_AU    |
| English (Canada)    | en_CA    |
| Vietnam             | vi_VN    |
