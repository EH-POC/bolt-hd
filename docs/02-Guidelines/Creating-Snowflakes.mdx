# Creating Snowflakes

:::caution
Snowflakes are customizations or deviations from the original Hero Design components. While some snowflakes are acceptable, others may not align with our goal of UI consistency. Please process with caution.
:::

Please follow this process before creating snowflakes:

## Step 1: Initiate the design

- Start to design the page/module based on feature requirements.
- Leverage the existing Hero Design components as much as possible.
- If the existing components do not meet the requirements, reach out to Hero Design cooridnators (UX & Andromeda) for guidance. This could be done via Slack channel [#eh-hero-design](https://employmenthero.slack.com/archives/CHWMT4F44).

## Step 2: Clarify component requirements

- Andromeda and squad team to discuss the requirements with the design team to understand the design intent.
- There are 3 senarios that could happen:
  1. **Case 1**: If the design intent is not reasonale, the design team will guide the squad team to use the existing components.
  2. **Case 2**: If the design intent is a common and reusable pattern, the design team will create a new component in the Hero Design library or enhance the existing components. Go to [Step 3.1](#step-3-1-create-a-new-component-in-hero-design-library) for more details.
  3. **Case 3**: If the design intent is a one-off pattern, the design team will create a new component for the project level only. Go to [Step 3.2](#step-3-2-create-a-new-component-for-the-project-level) for more details.

## Step 3: Implementation

### Step 3.1: Create a new component in Hero Design library

:::info
For Andromeda to handle Case 2
:::

- Andromeda will implement the new component/update the existing component in the Hero Design library.
- The new component will be released in the next version of the Hero Design library.
- Squad team use next version of Hero Design to implement new feature.

### Step 3.2: Create a new component for the project level

:::info
For squad team to handle Case 3
:::

- Squad team use existing Hero Design tokens and components if possible to create the new component (this is now considered as snowflake) in their module codebase only.
- Open pull request for snowflake code review. By default, snowflake PRs should be prevented from merging by snowflake-guard bot until approved by Andromeda team.
- Reach out to Andromeda for code review and snowflake approval.
- Once approved, ask repository admins to merge the PR and release the feature.

This process is a part of design system governance model to ensure the consistency and maintainability of the design system. For a viusal look of the process, please refer to this [workflow diagram](https://employmenthero.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ANDR/pages/1841463484/Design+system+governance+model).
