# Layout general guidelines

Currently, there are 3 types of layout that be used in a page:

- Full
- Primary
- Grid

## Full

- Always use Full width with containers that contain dense tables/content.

#### Full: Web

- Always leave `24px` spacing around each container.
- The container width should fit the full width no matter the screen size.

```jsx live
function FullWeb() {
  return (
    <Website>
      <SideNavigationBar />
      <Page sx={{ p: 'large' }}>
        <PageBreadcrumb />
        <PageHeader title="Page title" />
        <Container sx={{ mb: 'large' }}>Max width</Container>
        <Container>Max width</Container>
      </Page>
    </Website>
  );
}
```

#### Full: Tablet

- Always leave `16px` left and right spacing.
- Always leave `24px` top and bottom spacing (there could be a container above and below).
- The container width should fit the full width no matter the Tablet screen size.
- As the screen size or window reduces in width, the Primary size should maintain `736px` width until it no longer fits within the frame while keeping `16px` left and right for spacing as a minimum. At this breakpoint the Primary should convert to Mobile view.
- Taken into account the above, there are numerous screens sizes, thus we should allow for wider widths, as long as the `16px` side margins are kept.

```jsx live
function FullTablet() {
  return (
    <Website>
      <Page
        sx={{
          maxWidth: '768px',
          pt: 'large',
          pb: 'large',
          pl: 'medium',
          pr: 'medium',
        }}
      >
        <PageBreadcrumb />
        <PageHeader title="Page title" />
        <Container sx={{ mb: 'large' }}>Max width</Container>
        <Container>Max width</Container>
      </Page>
    </Website>
  );
}
```

#### Full: Mobile

- Always leave `8px` left and right spacing.
- Always leave `24px` top and bottom spacing (there could be a container above and below).
- As the max width size is `360px`, the side spacing will depend on whatever the screen size or window size that the user is using, but should never exceed past the `8px` left and right spacing.
- Taken into account the above, there are numerous screens sizes, thus we should allow for wider widths, as long as the `8px` side margins are kept.
- The container width should fit the full width no matter the Mobile screen size.

```jsx live
function FullMobile() {
  return (
    <Website>
      <Page
        sx={{
          maxWidth: '376px',
          pt: 'large',
          pb: 'large',
          pl: 'small',
          pr: 'small',
        }}
      >
        <PageBreadcrumb />
        <PageHeader title="Page title" />
        <Container sx={{ mb: 'large' }}>Max width</Container>
        <Container>Max width</Container>
      </Page>
    </Website>
  );
}
```

## Primary

- Always use Primary width with containers for most of the platform, as most containers do not need to be full width.

#### Primary: Web

- Always leave `24px` spacing around each container (other container may be above or below).
- As the max width size is `1128px`, the side spacing will depend on whatever the screen size or window that the user is using, but should never exceed past the `24px` left and right spacing margins.
- As the screen size or window reduces in width, the Primary size should maintain `1128px` width until it no longer fits within the frame while keeping `24px` left and right for spacing as a minimum. At this breakpoint the Primary should convert to Tablet view.

```jsx live
function PrimaryWeb() {
  return (
    <Website>
      <SideNavigationBar />
      <Page sx={{ p: 'large', display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <Box sx={{ maxWidth: '1128px', flex: 1 }}>
          <PageBreadcrumb />
          <PageHeader title="Page title" />
          <Container sx={{ mb: 'large' }}>1128px max width</Container>
          <Container>1128px max width</Container>
        </Box>
      </Page>
    </Website>
  );
}
```

#### Primary: Tablet

- Always leaving `16px` left and right spacing.
- Always leave `24px`, top and bottom spacing (there could be a container above and below).
- As the max width size is `1128px`, the side spacing will depend on whatever the screen size or window size that the user is using, but should never exceed past the `16px` left and right spacing.
- The container width should fit the full width no matter the Tablet screen size.
- As the screen size or window reduces in width, the Primary size should maintain `736px` width until it no longer fits within the frame while keeping `16px` left and right for spacing as a minimum. At this breakpoint the Primary should convert to Mobile view.
- Taken into account the above, there are numerous screens sizes, thus we should allow for wider widths, as long as the `16px` side margins are kept.

```jsx live
function PrimaryTablet() {
  return (
    <Website>
      <Page
        sx={{
          maxWidth: '768px',
          pt: 'large',
          pb: 'large',
          pl: 'medium',
          pr: 'medium',
        }}
      >
        <PageBreadcrumb />
        <PageHeader title="Page title" />
        <Container sx={{ mb: 'large' }}>Max width</Container>
        <Container>Max width</Container>
      </Page>
    </Website>
  );
}
```

#### Primary: Mobile

- Always leaving `8px` left and right spacing
- Always leave `24px`, top and bottom spacing (there could be a container above and below).
- As the max width size is `360px`, the side spacing will depend on whatever the screen size or window size that the user is using, but should never exceed past the `8px` left and right spacing.
- Taken into account the above, there are numerous screens sizes, thus we should allow for wider widths, as long as the `8px` side margins are kept.
- The container width should fit the full width no matter the Mobile screen size.

```jsx live
function PrimaryMobile() {
  return (
    <Website>
      <Page
        sx={{
          maxWidth: '376px',
          pt: 'large',
          pb: 'large',
          pl: 'small',
          pr: 'small',
        }}
      >
        <PageBreadcrumb />
        <PageHeader title="Page title" />
        <Container sx={{ mb: 'large' }}>Max width</Container>
        <Container>Max width</Container>
      </Page>
    </Website>
  );
}
```

## Grid

- Always use Grid width with layouts that need multiple sections for information that need to be separate.

#### Grid: Web

- This grid consists of:
  - Primary `1128px`: on it's own row
  - Secondary `744px`: 2/3 of Primary
  - Tertiary `360px`: 1/3 of Primary
- Always leaving `24px` spacing around each container, and in between secondary and tertiary containers.
- As the max width size is `1128px`, the side spacing will depend on whatever the screen size or window that the user is using, but should never exceed past the `24px` left and right spacing margins.
- As the screen size or window reduces in width, the Grid Primary size should maintain `1128px` width until it no longer fits within the frame while keeping `24px` left and right for spacing as a minimum. At this breakpoint the Primary should convert to Grid Tablet view.
- As the screen size or window reduces in width, the Grid Secondary size should maintain `744px` width until it no longer fits within the frame while keeping `24px` left and right for spacing as a minimum. At this breakpoint the Secondary should convert to Grid Tablet view.
- As the screen size or window reduces in width, the Grid Tertiary size should maintain `360px` width until it no longer fits within the frame while keeping `24px` left and right for spacing as a minimum. At this breakpoint the Tertiary should convert to Grid Tablet view

```jsx live
function GridWeb() {
  return (
    <Website>
      <SideNavigationBar />
      <Page sx={{ p: 'large', display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <Box sx={{ maxWidth: '1128px', flex: 1 }}>
          <PageBreadcrumb />
          <PageHeader title="Page title" />
          <Grid gutter="large">
            <Grid.Row>
              <Grid.Col>
                <Container>Primary size: 1128px max width</Container>
              </Grid.Col>
            </Grid.Row>
            <Grid.Row gutter={['large', 'large']}>
              <Grid.Col span={[24, 24, 24, 16, 16]}>
                <Container>Secondary size: 744px max width</Container>
              </Grid.Col>
              <Grid.Col span={[24, 24, 24, 8, 8]}>
                <Container>Tertiary size: 360px max width</Container>
              </Grid.Col>
            </Grid.Row>
          </Grid>
        </Box>
      </Page>
    </Website>
  );
}
```

#### Grid: Tablet

This Tablet grid consist of 2 options:

- TABLET STACK 1: `24px` top and bottom spacing of each container, `16px` for left & right spacing.

  - Primary: `736px` wide, `24px` spacing
  - Secondary: `736px` wide, `24px` spacing
  - Secondary: `736px` wide, `24px` spacing

```jsx live
function GirdTablet1() {
  return (
    <Website>
      <Page
        sx={{
          maxWidth: '768px',
          pt: 'large',
          pb: 'large',
          pl: 'medium',
          pr: 'medium',
        }}
      >
        <PageBreadcrumb />
        <PageHeader title="Page title" />
        <Grid gutter="large">
          <Grid.Row>
            <Grid.Col>
              <Container>Primary size: 736px width (height may vary)</Container>
            </Grid.Col>
          </Grid.Row>
          <Grid.Row gutter={['large', 'large']}>
            <Grid.Col>
              <Container>
                Secondary size: 736px width (height may vary)
              </Container>
            </Grid.Col>
            <Grid.Col>
              <Container sx={{ height: '200px' }}>
                Tertiary size: 736px width (height may vary)
              </Container>
            </Grid.Col>
          </Grid.Row>
        </Grid>
      </Page>
    </Website>
  );
}
```

- TABLET STACK 2: `24px` top and bottom spacing of each container, `24px` spacing in between containers, `16px` for left & right spacing
  - Primary: `736px` wide, `24px` spacing
  - Secondary: `356px` wide, `24px` spacing
  - Tertiary: `356px` wide, `24px` spacing

```jsx live
function GridTablet2() {
  return (
    <Website>
      <Page
        sx={{
          maxWidth: '768px',
          pt: 'large',
          pb: 'large',
          pl: 'medium',
          pr: 'medium',
        }}
      >
        <PageBreadcrumb />
        <PageHeader title="Page title" />
        <Grid gutter="large">
          <Grid.Row>
            <Grid.Col>
              <Container>Primary size: 736px width (height may vary)</Container>
            </Grid.Col>
          </Grid.Row>
          <Grid.Row gutter={['large', 'large']}>
            <Grid.Col span={[24, 24, 24, 12, 12]}>
              <Container>
                Secondary size: 356px width (height may vary)
              </Container>
            </Grid.Col>
            <Grid.Col span={[24, 24, 24, 12, 12]}>
              <Container sx={{ height: '200px' }}>
                Tertiary size: 356px width (height may vary)
              </Container>
            </Grid.Col>
          </Grid.Row>
        </Grid>
      </Page>
    </Website>
  );
}
```

- As the screen size or window reduces in width, the Grid size should maintain `736px` width as a group until it no longer fits within the frame while keeping `16px` left and right for spacing as a minimum. At this breakpoint the Grid should convert to Mobile view.
- Taken into account the above, there are numerous screens sizes, thus we should allow for wider widths, as long as the `12px` side margins are kept.

#### Grid: Mobile

- This grid consist of 1 size for each container:
  - Primary: `360px` - on it's own row
  - Secondary: `360px` - on it's own row
  - Tertiary: `360px` - on it's own row
- Always leave `8px` left and right spacing
- Always leave `24px`, top and bottom spacing (there could be a container above and below).
- As the max width size is `360px`, the side spacing will depend on whatever the screen size or window size that the user is using, but should never exceed past the `8px` left and right spacing margins.
- Taken into account the above, there are numerous screens sizes, thus we should allow for wider widths, as long as the `8px` side margins are kept.
- The container width should fit the full width no matter the Mobile screen size.

```jsx live
function GridMobile() {
  return (
    <Website>
      <Page
        sx={{
          maxWidth: '376px',
          pt: 'large',
          pb: 'large',
          pl: 'small',
          pr: 'small',
        }}
      >
        <PageBreadcrumb />
        <PageHeader title="Page title" />
        <Grid gutter="large">
          <Grid.Row>
            <Grid.Col>
              <Container>Primary size: 360px width (height may vary)</Container>
            </Grid.Col>
          </Grid.Row>
          <Grid.Row gutter={['large', 'large']}>
            <Grid.Col>
              <Container>
                Secondary size: 360px width (height may vary)
              </Container>
            </Grid.Col>
            <Grid.Col>
              <Container sx={{ height: '200px' }}>
                Tertiary size: 360px width (height may vary)
              </Container>
            </Grid.Col>
          </Grid.Row>
        </Grid>
      </Page>
    </Website>
  );
}
```
