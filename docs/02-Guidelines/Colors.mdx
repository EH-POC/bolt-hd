# Colors

<Banner

  content="Hero Design color palette is built based on 12 main colors which are captured from the product of Employment Hero by adjusting their brightness."

## Palette

<Palette />

The palette can be easily extended by adding new main colors and using same color generator to generate their derivative colors.

<br />

## Usage

The palette is divided into two subsets for different usage purposes: Semantic and Data Visualisation.

### Semantic

Semantic colors are the name conventions shared across the team: POs, UI/UXers, Hero-design maintainers and Employment Hero developers. Each convention has a consistent meaning in all components of Hero-design and Employment Hero products.

### Data Visualisation

### Note for snowflake usages

- In case hero-design can't support the case you need, feel free to [fire a ticket](https://github.com/Thinkei/hero-design/issues/new/choose) to discuss the new feature or enhancement that we can work together to improve hero-design coverage.
- If the request won't be supported by hero-design (confirmed by hero-design maintainers), we will make decision together (must be approved by hero-design maintainers & UI/UXers) to modify the default support of hero-design or write our own components using hero-design theming to minimise the effort needed for future rebranding / white-labeling. Then colors should be considered to be used as:
  - `Semantic`: primary, primaryBackground, defaultBorder,...are used to create/modify the components aligned with future branding update / white-labeling.
  - `Palette`: yellowLight90, yellowLight60,... for absolute value references and do NOT expect them to be updated when rebranding is changed. An example of this is visualising data in a graph.
