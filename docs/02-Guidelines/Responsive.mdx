const Container = styled.div`
  ${({ theme }) => {
    return css`
      @media (min-width: ${theme.breakpoints.small}) {
        display: none;
      }

## Using on Components level

- If you want to use these breakpoints on component level, you can take a look at [MediaQuery](../components/mediaquery) component.
