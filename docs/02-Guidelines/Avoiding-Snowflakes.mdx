# Avoiding Snowflakes

Hero Design team has implemented a workflow in most web and mobile projects to detect various snowflakes. Below you can find a comprehensive list of how to avoid them to ensure consistency and maintainability.

## Use design tokens

**Design tokens** should be treated as **a single source of truth** for design decisions. They are the foundation of our design system and should be used in all projects.

While using **hardcoded values** might not seem like a big deal at first, it will make it harder to maintain the project in the long run. If you need to change a color or a font size, you will have to change it in multiple places instead of just one.

```jsx {5,12} showLineNumbers
<Button
    variant="filled"
    intent="primary"
    text="Primary"
    style={{ marginRight: 16 }}
/>

<Button
    variant="filled"
    intent="primary"
    text="Primary"
    style={{ marginRight: theme.space.medium }} // Use design token instead.
/>
```

The **`theme`** object should be returned from the **`useTheme`** hook, please avoid importing it directly from **`@hero-design/react`** since it will not have theming support.

```jsx {4} showLineNumbers
import { useTheme } from 'styled-components';

const Example = () => {
  const theme = useTheme();
  // Rest of your code
};
```

For a list of available design tokens, please refer to [**Web design tokens**](/web/web-design-tokens).

## Avoid customizing existing components

Hero Design components and their use cases are implemented according to the [**official Web UI Kit**](<https://www.figma.com/file/YKhWvtDlIAbAhdILeTu9FP/Hero-Design-UI-Kit-1.1-(Brand-update-CURRENT)?type=design&node-id=1090-14597&mode=design&t=HyO9CnSz2GmY5n1j-4>) and should be used whenever possible.

If you have UIs or functions that our components have yet to support, please avoid customizing them without [**consulting with the designers and the Andromeda team**](https://employmenthero.slack.com/archives/CHWMT4F44) first to discuss the best approach.

```jsx {4-6,11-12} showLineNumbers
<Button
    text="Secondary"
  style={{
    color: theme.colors.secondary,
    backgroundColor: 'transparent',
    borderRadius: theme.radii.rounded,  // This should be avoided.
  }}
/>
<Button
    text="Secondary"
    variant="outlined"
  intent="secondary" // Use existing intents and variants instead.
/>
```

## Avoid using internal components theme keys

Hero Design components have their own sets of internal theme keys that are not meant to be used outside. They are contained in a special **`__hd__`** field in the **`theme`** object and should be avoided.

```jsx {5,12} showLineNumbers
<CustomComponent
  text="Press me"
  onPress={() => alert('Pressed')}
  style={{
    fontSize: theme.__hd__.button.fontSize.default,  // This should be avoided.
  }}
/>
<CustomComponent
  text="Press me"
  onPress={() => alert('Pressed')}
  style={{
    fontSize: theme.fontSizes.xlarge,  // Use design token instead.
  }}
/>
```

## Avoid importing colors from @hero-design/colors

For most cases, **semantic colors** should be extracted and used from the **`theme.colors`** object, instead of imported from the **@hero-design/colors** package, this will ensure that the colors are consistent and correctly themed.

For a list of semantic colors and their use cases, please refer to [**Web colors**](/web/Guidelines/colors#semantic) section.

```jsx {8,15} showLineNumbers
import { ebensPalette } from '@hero-design/colors';

//...
<CustomComponent
  text="Press me"
  onPress={() => alert('Pressed')}
  style={{
    color: ebensPalette.white, // This should be avoided.
  }}
/>
<CustomComponent
  text="Press me"
  onPress={() => alert('Pressed')}
  style={{
    color: theme.colors.onDarkGlobalSurface, // Use design token from theme instead.
  }}
  />
```

## Try to utilize @ehrocks/hero-design-react components

Hero Design is being actively developed and maintained by the **Andromeda team**. We are constantly working to add new components and features to the library. You can check the [**Changelog**](/changelog/web) section or [**our Roadmap**](https://employmenthero.atlassian.net/wikiOverview) to see what we are working on.

If you have a UI that needs to be implemented with a **3rd party component**, please first [**consult with the designers and the Andromeda team**](https://employmenthero.slack.com/archives/CHWMT4F44) to see if it could be widely used enough to be added to the UI Kit, then we will implement it as a **Hero Design component**.
