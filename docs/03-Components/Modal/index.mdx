# Modal

Modal is used for showing contents or requiring interaction from users without directing to a new page.

## Examples

### Basic

A modal has 3 sections including `Title`, `Body` and `Footer`.

```jsx live
function BasicModal() {
  const [openBasic, setOpenBasic] = React.useState(false);
  const [openPrimary, setOpenPrimary] = React.useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <Button
        text="Open basic modal"
        onClick={() => setOpenBasic((value) => !value)}
        style={{ marginRight: theme.space.small }}
      />
      <Button
        text="Open primary modal"
        onClick={() => setOpenPrimary((value) => !value)}
      />
      {openBasic && (
        <Modal
          title="Basic modal"
          open
          variant="basic"
          onClose={() => setOpenBasic(false)}
          body="Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
          footer={
            <>
              <Button
                text="Cancel"
                variant="text"
                onClick={() => setOpenBasic(false)}
              />
              <Button text="Submit" onClick={() => setOpenBasic(false)} />
            </>
          }
        />
      )}
      {openPrimary && (
        <Modal
          title="Primary modal"
          open
          variant="primary"
          onClose={() => setOpenPrimary(false)}
          body="Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
          footer={
            <>
              <Button
                text="Cancel"
                variant="text"
                onClick={() => setOpenPrimary(false)}
              />
              <Button text="Submit" onClick={() => setOpenPrimary(false)} />
            </>
          }
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

### Control modal sizes

Using size prop to display different modal sizes.

```jsx live
function ModalWithSizes() {
  const [openSmall, setOpenSmall] = React.useState(false);
  const [openMedium, setOpenMedium] = React.useState(false);
  const [openLarge, setOpenLarge] = React.useState(false);
  const [openExtraLarge, setOpenExtraLarge] = React.useState(false);
  const [openDoubleExtraLarge, setOpenDoubleExtraLarge] = React.useState(false);
  const [openFullScreenModal, setOpenFullScreenModal] = React.useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', gap: 'small', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
        <Button text="Open small modal" onClick={() => setOpenSmall(true)} />
        <Button text="Open medium modal" onClick={() => setOpenMedium(true)} />
        <Button text="Open large modal" onClick={() => setOpenLarge(true)} />
        <Button
          text="Open extra large modal"
          onClick={() => setOpenExtraLarge(true)}
        />
        <Button

          onClick={() => setOpenDoubleExtraLarge(true)}

### PopUp Modal

Use this modal to provide feedbacks to users. There are 5 variants: `info`, `success`, `warning`, `danger` and `confirm`.

```jsx live
function PopupModal() {
  const [openInfo, setOpenInfo] = React.useState(false);
  const [openSuccess, setOpenSuccess] = React.useState(false);
  const [openWarning, setOpenWarning] = React.useState(false);

  const [openConfirm, setOpenConfirm] = React.useState(false);
  return (

            </>
          }
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

### Modal rendering customisation

Modal also exposes several components which allow you to fully customize the content UI:

- Modal.Header
- Modal.Body
- Modal.Footer
- Modal.CloseButton

In below example, we will render a modal with an image header.

```jsx live
function CustomModal() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);
  const onClose = React.useCallback(() => setOpen(false), [setOpen]);
  return (
    <>
      <Button text="Custom Modal" onClick={() => setOpen((value) => !value)} />
      <Modal open={open} size="xlarge" onClose={onClose}>
        <div style={{ position: 'relative', margin: 0, padding: 0 }}>
          <img
            style={{
              width: '100%',
              borderTopLeftRadius: theme.radii.base,
              borderTopRightRadius: theme.radii.base,
              margin: 'auto',
              padding: 0,
            }}
            alt="demo"
            src="/img/modal-banner.jpg"
          />
          <Modal.CloseButton
            style={{
              position: 'absolute',
              right: theme.space.medium,
              top: theme.space.medium,
            }}
            onClick={onClose}
          />
        </div>
        <Modal.Body>
          <Typography.Title level={4}>
            Welcome to your new Custom Security
          </Typography.Title>
          <Typography.Text
            intent="body"
            style={{
              marginTop: theme.space.small,
              marginBottom: theme.space.medium,
            }}
          >
            We&apos;ve made improvements to the Custom Security Groups module
            and we&apos;re excited to share them with you!
          </Typography.Text>
          <Alert
            variant="outlined"
            title="Note"
            content="Legacy custom security will no longer be supported and you'll no longer have access to the beta custom report."
          />
        </Modal.Body>
        <Modal.Footer>
          <Button variant="text" text="Ask me later" onClick={onClose} />
          <Button text="Start" onClick={onClose} />
        </Modal.Footer>
      </Modal>
    </>
  );
}
```
