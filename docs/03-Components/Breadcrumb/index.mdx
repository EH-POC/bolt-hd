# Breadcrumb

Breadcrumbs identify the path to the current resource in an application. It is useful to:

- Inform users of where they are.
- Help users to navigate back to a higher page level.

## Examples

### Basic

Breadcrumb components require a list of `BreadcrumbItem` passed through `items` property.

```jsx live
function BasicBreadcrumb() {
  const breadcrumbItems = [
    { href: 'https://employmenthero.com', text: 'Home' },
    {
      href: 'https://employmenthero.com/benefits',
      text: 'Benefits',
    },
    {
      href: 'https://employmenthero.com/benefits/for-employers',
      text: 'For Employers',
    },
  ];
  return <Breadcrumb items={breadcrumbItems} />;
}
```

### With React Router

Breadcrumb can be used with `react-router` by set `withRouter` true for BreadcrumbItem. By this way `Link` component from `react-router-dom` will be rendered instead of a normal `a` tag. It is commonly used for SPA navigation.

```javascript
const breadcrumbItems = [
  { href: '#', text: 'Home', withRouter:  true },
  {
    href: '/#/benefits,
    text: 'Benefits',
    withRouter: true,
  },
  {
    href: '/#/for-employers',
    text: 'For Employers',
    withRouter: true,
  },
];
```

### Single usage

When `items` has only one breadcrumb, it will turn on single mode. This is used as a shortcut coming back to home or parent page.

```jsx live
function SingleBreadcrumb() {
  const breadcrumbItems = [
    { href: 'https://employmenthero.com', text: 'Home' },
  ];
  return <Breadcrumb items={breadcrumbItems} />;
}
```
