# Spinner

Spinners indicate an operation under loading process.

## Examples

### Basic

Use spinner with or without text.

```jsx live
<>
  <Spinner />
  <Spinner text="We're fetching your data..." />
</>
```

### Spinner with content

Spinner can be used to wrap some content. It will spin while fetching the content.

<Note title="Visibility note">
  <Ul>
    <Li>The content is ALWAYS displayed regardless to loading.</Li>
    <Li>The spinning element is ONLY displayed when to loading is true.</Li>
  </Ul>
</Note>

```jsx live
<Spinner loading size="small">
  <Typography.Text>
    With Employment Hero you can paperlessly onboard staff, provide induction
    content, conduct visa checks and performance reviews. We also help you stay
    compliant with built in contracts, policies and HR templates ready to go.
  </Typography.Text>
</Spinner>
```

### Sizes

There are three sizes of a Spinner: `small`, `medium` (default) and `large`.

```jsx live
<>
  <Spinner size="small" text="Loading..." />
  <br />
  <Spinner size="medium" text="Loading..." />
  <br />
  <Spinner size="large" text="Loading..." />
</>
