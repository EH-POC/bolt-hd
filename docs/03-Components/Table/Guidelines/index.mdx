## Table Guidelines

### Principle 1: First column[^1] should be the identifying column

[^1]First column for data (i.e. showing information) rather than UI actions like expand/collapse or checkbox.

**Identifying column**

- Contains the most relevant/useful information to help users choose a row to see more info.

**Use of avatar**

- Use avatar when personnel name is the identifying column.
- Do not use avatar when personnel name is not the identifying column.
- Do not use an avatar for other non-personnel, e.g. candidates.

**Column headings**

- Be very succint, the heading text should fit in a single row of text.
- When scrolling the table, the column heading will be sticky so it's always visible.

  <ColumnHeadingTablePrinciple />
</div>

### Principle 2: Tables should have 1 primary row action (identifying column) and 1 or many secondary row actions (last column)

**Primary row action**

- The most common call-to-action - the thing you expect users to do most frequently.
- Usually linked from the _identifying column_.
- Where there is more information available on an object, the identifying column should be the _primary action_ and be selectable (clickable & tappable).
- Sometimes a single column is not enough as the identifying column, you should choose 1 column as the identifying column with the primary action (don‚Äôt repeat the primary action on 2 columns).
  - e.g. Timesheet management: Personnel & time/date combined identifies a timesheet, but only 1 column is the identifying column.

**Secondary row action**

- The second most common call-to-actions performed by users.
- Only appear in the last (right most) column.
- The row action should have right alignment.
- All secondary row actions should be available from detailed view.
- 1 secondary row action: use a text button.
- 2 or more secondary row actions: use **Ellipsis icon** (<Icon icon="more-horizontal" /> 3 horizontal dots) and show actions within the menu.
- Secondary row actions can be used without a primary row action when there isn't any more info available (no detailed view).

</div>

**Exception 1: No detailed view of a table object**

When there is not detailed page, and all actions must be visible from the table using the Actions list.

- There will be no View option (since there is no detailed view).

### Principle 3: It `must` be clear what search terms or filters have been applied to the table

**Default filters**

- By default the table should have a sensible sort order (most useful/relevant items on top), in which case no filters should be applied.
- When a filter is applied, it should be visually highlighted.
- Recommend no more than 7 filters - not a hard rule but more than 7 gets complicated.

**Persistent filters**

- Filters should be automatically remembered when user leave the page and return within the session - up to Product squads to implement this.
  - This has already been supported by hero-design via Table.useFilterState, Table.getLSCacheProvider:

```typescript
export type CacheProvider<T> = {
  load: () => Promise<T | null>;
  save: (value: T) => Promise<void>;
};
const cacheProvider = Table.getLSCacheProvider('examples/leaveFilters');

const { filterValues, setFilterValues } = Table.useFiltersState({
  initialValues: initialFilterValues,
  cacheProvider,
  cacheOnChange: true,
});
```

**Reset filters**

- Users can clear all filters to show all rows.

**Search**

- Free text search looks for any words or numbers.

### Principle 4: Show enough rows to make the table immediately useful without impacting performance/load time (recommend 50 rows by default)

**Rows per page:**

- Options should be 25, 50, 100 per page.

### Principle 5: Rows should be sorted by primary column by default - sort order should be very clear

Default sort order should be intuitive, e.g.

- Recency: if there is a Date is a column, this is usually good column to sort by, most recent at the top.
  - e.g. Date added, Date modified, Leave start date, Requested date,

### Principle 6: Cell alignment

**Cell alignment rules:**

- **Text**: Left-aligned - Text content should be left-aligned for natural reading flow and optimal readability.
- **Numbers**: Right-aligned - Numerical values should be right-aligned to make it easier to compare values and perform mental calculations, as this aligns decimal points and creates visual columns of numbers.
- **Percentages**: Right-aligned - Percentage values should be right-aligned for consistent number formatting and easy comparison, following the same principles as numerical data.
- **Currency**: Right-aligned - Currency amounts should be right-aligned to align decimal points and make financial data easier to scan and compare across rows.
- **Date/time**: Left-aligned - Date and time values should be left-aligned for natural reading flow and chronological scanning, as users typically read dates from left to right.
- **Action cells**: Right-aligned - Action buttons and controls should be right-aligned to create a clear visual separation from data content and are typically placed in the last column for consistent user experience.

This alignment strategy helps users quickly scan and compare data, especially numerical values, while maintaining readability for text-based content.

## Table Styling

There are a few things to take into consideration when designing a Table using [Hero Design's Table](/web/components/table/basic) component:

- First column should always be clickable.
- If you have a column where there can only be one default value, consider using a [Badge](/web/components/badge) in another column (e.g Name) for better visualization. Best to use the **outlined** version.
- For actions column, we prefer showing 3 dots icons.
- Highlighted row should be in a color that is distinguised from the title row color.
- We don't need to wrap a table inside a container.
