      "technical_description": "The example uses a React fragment (<>...</>) to encapsulate the Timeline component, which is a common practice to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. The Timeline component is passed a prop named 'items', which is an array of objects. Each object in the array represents an event or item in the timeline, containing an 'id', 'text', and 'helpText'. The 'id' is a unique identifier for each item, 'text' is the main description of the event, and 'helpText' provides additional information or context. The Timeline component is expected to iterate over this array and render each item accordingly, likely using the 'id' as a key for efficient rendering.",

Additionally, it uses an array of objects to manage and render a list of items, a common pattern in React for handling dynamic lists. The use of unique 'id' properties for each item is a best practice for ensuring efficient updates and rendering in React, as it allows React to track and manage changes to each item individually.",

It can be used in applications that require users to track progress or understand the sequence of events, such as project management tools, educational platforms, or onboarding processes. The simplicity of the implementation makes it suitable for basic use cases where a straightforward presentation of events is needed without complex interactions or customizations."
